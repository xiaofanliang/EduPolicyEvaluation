# Policy Evaluation for Department of Education, Argentina
We worked with Data Head Axel McCallum at Department of Education, Argentina to conduct a policy evaluation for the Jornada Extendida and Jornada Completa Programs. We used genetic matching to calculate the treatment effect and compared the effect across regions, years, and urban-rural seperation. 

Here are a few selections of the outcome from the [writeup](https://github.com/xiaofanliang/EduPolicyEvaluation/blob/master/decisionmemo.pdf)
